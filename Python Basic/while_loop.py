# While Loop
"""
Using loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
OR
while loops are defined using the while keyword, and they repeat their block until the condition is evaluated as False :
"""
# Example 1:
a = int(input(" Enter a number for while loop: "))
while a < 9:
 print(a)
 a = a+1

# Example 2:
count = 0
while count < 10:
 print("The condition is True")
 count = count + 1
print("After the loop")
